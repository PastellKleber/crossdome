# CrossDome #1
This is my take on a digital version of the first issue of Crossdome, a german diskmag about techno, lifestyle and C64 programs and tools.

Steps:

1. Copying the text out of the vice emulator and cleaning it up for further use.
2. Establishing a dictionary for special characters (glyphs)
3. Using tei to structure the magazine
4. Transforming the XML-file with XSL and a suitable CSS stylesheet into a HTML-file of Crossdome
